## Get downstream names!!

We can also get downstream names, in this case all species from the genus *Apis*, getting data from the Catalogue of Life

```{r coldown}
col_downstream(name="Apis", downto="Species")
```

Or get data from ITIS, in this case get genera downstream from _Pinaceae_

```{r itisdown1}
itis_downstream(tsns=18030, downto="Genus")
```

Get families downstream from _Acridoidea_

```{r itisdown2}
itis_downstream(tsns = 650497, "Family")
```
